= .jenkins folder

This folder intended to create jobs to automate some boring tasks
like creating a configurable job with prelisted docker images from artifactory.

At the moment groovy jenkins sandbox doesn't enable enough code to be executed
to go further so this is dead configuration but we keep it until it is whitelisted
and enabled.

To activate it back, add to the root `Jenkinsfile` the following stage:

[source,groovy]
----
stage('Update jobs') {
  when {
    anyOf {
      branch 'master'
    }
  }
  steps {
    jobDsl targets: '.jenkins/jobs/*.groovy',
           removedJobAction: 'DELETE',
           removedConfigFilesAction: 'DELETE',
           sandbox: true
  }
}
----
